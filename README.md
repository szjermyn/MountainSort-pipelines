## Codes and instructions

For pre-processing and post-processing codes for your local computer, see [LocalFiles](./LocalFiles) folder. Pre-processing scripts are found in msinput.py and post-processing scripts are found in msoutput.py.

For codes and files to be put on Banshee or any other Linux remote server, see [RemoteFiles](./RemoteFiles) folder. Scripts to run MountainSort are .ipynb files found in [this folder](./RemoteFiles/Codes). The [DefaultFiles](./RemoteFiles/DefaultFiles) contain .csv files which are probe configuration files typically used in the Coleman Lab and a parameter file that tells MountainSort the basic parameters to use for spike sorting.
